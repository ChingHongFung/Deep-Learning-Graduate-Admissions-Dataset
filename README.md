# Deep Learning: Graduate Admissions Dataset

This is a project looking at a graduate admissions dataset. The objective is to use a feature set composing students' past academic performance to predict the probability of college admission. A deep learning approach is used where I built and optimised a feedforward neural network using TensorFlow and Keras. Optimision is done on a set of hyperparameters including
